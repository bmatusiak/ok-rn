/**
 * v3.0.0 - the first of the 3.0 line, and the interesting one for the version
 * matrix: node-onlykey-lib/src/device/version.js draws its capability boundary
 * between the 2.1 and 3.0 generations, so this release and v2.1.2 are the pair
 * that decides whether those branches are right.
 *
 * IT WAS NEVER SIGNED. 3.0.0 went out as an unsigned beta and was skipped for
 * production, so there is no `Signed_OnlyKey_3_0_0_STD` and there is not going
 * to be one. `ok-versions.json` carries no `file` for this row because of that,
 * and it is the only row without one.
 *
 * The pins are still exact: both are the upstream release tags - `libraries`
 * v3.0.0-prod is 5515974 and OnlyKey-Firmware's is dc24867. So the absent
 * image costs nothing here. What it does mean is that this is the one release
 * whose behaviour cannot be checked against a shipped binary, and the only
 * thing measured against it is what this matrix measures itself.
