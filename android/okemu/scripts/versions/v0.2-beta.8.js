/**
 * v0.2-beta.8 - the 2019 beta line, and the only firmware whose OKCONNECT
 * reply uses the layout the library calls 'legacy'.
 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH REACHING FOR. Every other release in the matrix answers
 * OKCONNECT with the device public key at bytes 0..32. This one - it
 * defines `OKversion "v0.2-beta.8c"` at OnlyKey_Beta.ino:135 - puts it at
 * 21..53 with the version string in the clear before it, and the web app
 * has branched on that string since it was written
 * (onlykey-api.js:168-198). node-onlykey-lib learned to parse it in
 * transit.js and could not verify the branch against anything real,
 * because until this pin existed the matrix went back only to v2.1.0.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT STAGING IT. The sketch is at
 * OnlyKey_Beta/OnlyKey_Beta.ino rather than OnlyKey/OnlyKey.ino - a
 * different directory and a different file name - which is why stage.js
 * takes a `sketch` from the release rather than assuming one. Its library
 * pin has okcore, okcrypto, okeeprom and onlykey.h and no okpqc or
 * utility/, which is expected for 2019 and not by itself a problem: the
 * PQC paths are compiled from the newer tree or not at all.
 *
 * The patch list starts EMPTY on purpose. Every entry in _shared.js was
 * written against a specific line of a specific release, and guessing that
 * a 2019 tree needs the same ones would produce a pile of patches that
 * fail to apply and say nothing about why. The way this is meant to go is
 * the way the rungs in versions/index.js describe: run stage.js, read what
 * it names, add the one patch that fixes it, run again. Each rung is
 * something somebody watched happen.
 */
/*
 * THE SKETCH SEEDS ITS RNG FROM AN ADDRESS THAT IS A READING.
 *
 *   unsigned int analog1 = analogRead(ANALOGPIN1);
 *   RNG.stir((uint8_t *)analog1, sizeof(analog1), sizeof(analog1)*2);
 *
 * `analog1` is the sample, not a buffer. The cast turns a number between 0
 * and 1023 into a pointer and stir() reads four bytes from it. On a Teensy
 * that address is inside mapped flash, so it returns the same four bytes of
 * the device's own program image every boot - the seeding is wrong in a way
 * that still produces plausible output, which is why it shipped. On Android
 * the page is unmapped and the firmware thread dies in setup().
 *
 * The two fault addresses this was seen at, 0xe7 and 0x2e4, are 231 and 740.
 * They differ between runs because they are ADC samples, and that is what
 * identified the cast rather than the unrebased hardware register the notes
 * first suspected.
 *
 * Fixed by the firmware itself in OnlyKey-Firmware@926b052 (2020-05-22), the
 * commit that renamed the sketch: `RNG.stir((uint8_t *)&analog1, 2, 4)`. The
 * length drops to 2 because the reading is 16-bit after
 * analogReadResolution(16), and the entropy credit halves with it. This
 * patch takes only the ADDRESS, leaving the length and the credit as the
 * beta had them - the crash is the cast, and rewriting the rest would be
 * this repository deciding how much entropy a 2019 release was entitled to
 * claim.
 *
 * Version-local, not shared: no other release in the matrix contains the
 * line. See ok-rn/FINDING-the-beta-seeded-its-rng-from-an-address-that-was-a-number.md

/**
 * The 32-bit flash stride, spelled for the 2019 tree.
 *
 * IDENTICAL IN KIND to `_shared.js:flashWalkStride`, which every 2.x and 3.x
 * script imports and whose comment reads "without this the PIN never
 * matches". It cannot simply be imported here: this release predates the
 * rename, so its functions are `onlykey_flashget_common` /
 * `onlykey_flashset_common` where later ones are `okcore_*`, and stage.js
 * refuses a literal that does not match.
 *
 * Kept version-local rather than added to _shared.js on that file's own rule:
 * it holds patches MORE THAN ONE release needs, and exactly one release uses
 * this spelling.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY WHAT AILS THIS RELEASE. v2.1.2 was staged with
 * an empty patch list and showed precisely the symptom recorded below -
 * boots, provisions, reports INITIALIZED, every button arrives as itself, and
 * the unlock times out. Dumping flash.bin off the phone showed the nonce and
 * the PIN hash present at the right offsets with every other 32-bit word
 * missing, because `unsigned long` is 8 bytes on a 64-bit host and the walk
 * advances twice as far as the byte buffer beside it. Importing the shared
 * list took that release from blocked to 87 passed.

 * Setters handed a literal 0 where they dereference a pointer, 2019 spelling.

 * `onlykey_eeset_*` where later releases have `okeeprom_eeset_*`, and a

 *
 * MEASURED, from the tombstone rather than from reading:

 *     #00 onlykey_eeset_common+76

 *
 * The third site is spelled with a space before the paren and carries no

 * scanning the STAGED tree for setters whose first argument is a numeric
 * literal rather than by reading a diff.
