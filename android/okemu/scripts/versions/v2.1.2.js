/**
 * v2.1.2 - the pin was right all along, and it was on a BRANCH.
 *
 * ok-versions.json pins libraries@12eb5b0, and for most of this project's life
 * `git cat-file -e` failed on it, so nothing about this release could be
 * measured: not the patches, not a build, not a boot.
 *
 * The pin was never wrong. Upstream tags its releases, and `libraries` tag
 * `v2.1.2-prod` points at exactly 12eb5b0. The local checkouts are FORKS of
 * master with no tags, which is why it took the GitHub API to see it, and the
 * release was cut from the branch `remove-touchsense` rather than from master
 * - which is the whole reason a fork of master does not carry the commit.
 *
 * This file briefly said something else. It was repinned to `8f74eac` on the
 * reasoning that 12eb5b0 "is not one of the three commits that declare 2.1.2"
 * and that the pin should be the last commit of that range. Both halves were
 * wrong: the range rule was a guess read off three rows that happened to
 * agree, and the tags settle it directly. The pin is back to what it was.
 *
 * UNBLOCKED 2026-09-12, with the user's word, by fetching the branch upstream
 * cut it from. The fork's `origin` is bm-ok/0c-coder-libraries; the original
 * is trustcrypto, so that went in as a second remote:
 *
 *     git -C ../libraries remote add trustcrypto https://github.com/trustcrypto/libraries
 *     git -C ../libraries fetch trustcrypto remove-touchsense
 *
 * Objects only. `libraries` stayed on master with a clean working tree, which
 * is what makes this compatible with it being a read-only reference checkout.
 * `OnlyKey-Firmware@bbb910a` was already present and also matches its tag.

   * v2.1.1's list, and this file said it would NOT copy that list because
   * "guessing which apply here would record a measurement nobody made".
   * That caution cost most of a day. With no patches this release stages,
   * builds, boots, provisions - and stores its PIN hash at a 64-bit stride
   * into a 32-bit-word flash layout, so every other word is lost and the
   * PIN never matches. Read straight out of flash.bin after a provision:
   *
   *   +0..3   e3e66c62   <- nonce word 0, then FOUR BYTES OF 0xFF
   *   +8..11  50f04142   <- nonce word 1, then 0xFF again
   *   +64..67 e8124951   <- p1hash word 0, same stride
   *
   * That is `unsigned long *adr` being 8 bytes on the host, exactly what
   * shared.flashWalkStride exists for, and okcore_flashsector is byte-
   * identical to v2.1.1's. The others are here because the code they patch
   * is also unchanged from v2.1.1; stage.js refuses a literal that does not
   * match, so anything in this list that did not belong would have said so.
