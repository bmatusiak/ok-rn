/**
 * v3.0.2 - the newest release in ok-versions.json, and the first old version
 * taken all the way to a running, tested device.
 *
 * Every one of stage.js's shared patterns still matches here, so the 3.0 line
 * looked like a short job. It was not: this release needs THIRTEEN patches of
 * its own before it will run hosted, and each one was a defect present in the
 * shipped firmware that has been fixed upstream since. They are all in
 * _shared.js, with the measurement that found each.
 *
 * The one that mattered most is flashWalkStride. `unsigned long` is 8 bytes on
 * arm64 and 4 on the Teensy, so flash was walked at twice the stride of the
 * byte buffer beside it - and since the PIN hash goes through that path, a
 * CORRECT PIN read back as wrong. It is invisible on a 32-bit handset, which
 * is what the bench device happens to be.
 *
 * ## BOTH PINS ARE THE UPSTREAM RELEASE TAGS
 *
 * `libraries` tag v3.0.2-prod is 5d7ce7a and OnlyKey-Firmware's is 7671d6f -
 * exactly what is pinned. Confirmed through the GitHub API; the local
 * checkouts are forks and carry no tags of their own.
 *
 * This is worth stating because the pin LOOKS wrong. Three commits declare
 * 3.0.2 and this is the first of them: 5d7ce7a "testing 3.0.2" (2022-08-31),
 * then e80e7c6 and 5495501 (both 2022-10-25). A guess written here earlier
 * said the pin should move to the last of the three, by analogy with v3.0.0
 * and v3.0.1.
 *
 * The release date is what explains it. v3.0.2 was published on 2022-10-05 and
 * those two later commits landed three weeks AFTER it - they carry the 3.0.2
 * version number only because the macro is not bumped until the next cycle
 * starts. They were never in this release, and repinning to them would have
 * quietly replaced a measured release with a tree nobody received.
