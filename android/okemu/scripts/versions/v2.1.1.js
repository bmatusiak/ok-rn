  /*
   * THIS COMMIT IS THE TRAVEL EDITION, and that is not a small difference.
   *
   * `git show 0dc7cf0:onlykey/onlykey.h` has BOTH build options commented out:
   *
   *     //#define DEBUG //Enable Serial Monitor
   *     //#define STD_VERSION //Define for STD edition firmare, undefine for IN TRVL edition firmware
   *
   * Every other pin in ok-versions.json is the standard edition. STD_VERSION
   * gates set_private's body, U2Finit and the encrypted profile itself, so
   * without it `profilemode` is NONENCRYPTEDPROFILE and most of the device's
   * own code returns early - staged as pinned, this release cannot even be
   * given a PIN, because the per-digit prompts the bracket waits for are inside
   * that gate.
   *
   * So it is staged as STANDARD, to be comparable with the other four. That
   * flips a switch the firmware itself provides, in the throwaway copy, exactly
   * as OKEMU_DEBUG=1 does - and it is recorded here so that nobody reads a
   * standard result and concludes the commit was standard. Whether the released
   * v2.1.1 binary was standard or travel is not something this repository can
   * answer; the COMMIT is travel.
   *
   * `OKEMU_STD=0` still builds it as pinned, for anyone who wants to measure
   * the travel edition on purpose - nothing else in the matrix covers it.
