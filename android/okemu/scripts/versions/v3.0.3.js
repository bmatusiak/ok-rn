/**
 * v3.0.3 - one cycle on from v3.0.2, and the first release with no libraries
 * tag to pin it by.
 *
 * OnlyKey-Firmware tags v3.0.3-prod at 9600daa, which is also where
 * v3.0.4-prod points: the sketch did not change between the two releases, so
 * everything that distinguishes them is on the libraries side.
 *
 * And the libraries repository stops tagging at v3.0.2-prod. So this pin is
 * derived rather than read, by the rule in versions/index.js - the last commit
 * declaring the version at or before the release date. v3.0.3 was published on
 * 2022-11-08; a133bea "testing release" is 2022-11-04; the next commit
 * declaring 3.0.3 is 9c99922 on 2022-11-26, which is after the release and
 * therefore cannot be in it. That rule reproduces all seven tagged libraries
 * pins, which is the only reason to trust it here.
 *
 * The patch list starts as v3.0.2's, because that is the nearest measured
 * neighbour and a133bea is two commits later. Every entry is mandatory - a
 * pattern that does not match is an error, not a shrug - so the first stage
 * run says which of these this tree no longer needs, and `absentPatterns` is
 * where a deliberate gap gets declared.
