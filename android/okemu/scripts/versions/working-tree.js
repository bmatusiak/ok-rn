/**
 * The working tree - what stage.js builds when OKEMU_VERSION is unset.
 *
 * Not a release, and its own script for exactly that reason. Everything else
 * here is pinned to a commit in ok-versions.json; this one is whatever
 * OnlyKey-Firmware and libraries happen to be checked out at, which is the
 * generation ahead of the newest release. Without a script for it, every edit
 * the current sources need and no release does would have had to live in
 * stage.js as an unexplained special case.
 *
 * ## It keeps the unnamed storage slot
 *
 * `slot: ''`, so its flash.bin and eeprom.bin stay in files/okemu exactly where
 * they have always been. That is load-bearing rather than tidy: moving them
 * would strand the provisioned device on every phone that already has one, and
 * nothing re-provisions itself.
 *
 * ## DEBUG is ON here and OFF in every release
 *
 * onlykey.h:81 is `#define DEBUG` in this tree and `//#define DEBUG` at v3.0.2.
 * The difference is upstream's, not ours - somebody left the switch on while
 * working. It is why the soft key can be given a PIN at all by default, and why
 * a pinned release needs OKEMU_DEBUG=1 before it can be.

  /**
   * NO PATCHES. The one that lived here is retired, and the reason it gave was
   * WRONG.
   *
   * It deleted `void yield(void) {}` from OnlyKey.ino, and its justification -
   * written here and in commit fe2aeb6 - claimed a no-op yield() "stops the
   * clock", because okemu_sync_systick() would never run and every delay() and
   * poll loop reaches time through it.
   *
   * THAT IS NOT TRUE. android/okemu/src/ok_hal.cpp:356 starts a dedicated
   * thread calling okemu_sync_systick() every 500 us - "the honest emulation of
   * a hardware timer interrupt" - written precisely because feeding the counter
   * from micros() froze payload()'s wait loop. micros() syncs it as well. The
   * clock runs whatever the sketch's yield() does.
   *
   * What the patch actually resolved was a LINK ERROR: core-override's
   * okemu_pins.cpp defined yield() strongly, so the sketch gaining its own
   * definition made two strong ones - "duplicate symbol: yield". A real
   * failure, for a reason stated incorrectly, and a false WHY is the thing
   * this codebase warns about hardest: it survives longer than the code and
   * teaches the next reader something untrue.
   *
   * It needs no patch now. okemu_pins.cpp marks its yield() WEAK, matching the
   * Teensy core's own linkage, so the sketch's definition wins where it exists
   * and the emulator's is used where it does not - the choice left with the
   * firmware, which is where it belongs. stage.js also drops core/yield.cpp,
   * whose weak definition would otherwise be a coin flip on any tree whose
   * sketch has no yield() (see the DROP entry).
   *
   * Retiring it also removes this project's only edit to OnlyKey.ino - the
   * file most likely to be reformatted upstream.

   * APPID_NULL_GUARD's line is gone, because UPSTREAM FIXED IT.

   * ctap.cpp's add_existing_user_info() passes NULL on every allowList

   *     else if (memcmp(trusted[t].name, rpid, trusted[t].namelen) == 0) ...

   * `appid_match1`, `appid_match2` and the per-origin variables are all gone
   * with it.
   *
   * Declared absent rather than dropped from the shared list, because every
   * PINNED release still has the old spelling and still needs the guard.
   * stage.js throws if this line ever comes back, so the claim cannot go stale
