/*
 * One stage script per firmware release.
 *
 *     OKEMU_VERSION=v3.0.2 node scripts/stage.js
 *
 * stage.js is the ENGINE - the patches every version needs, the flash rebase,
 * the system-block rewrite. What differs release to release lives in
 * `scripts/versions/<version>.js`, one file per entry in ok-versions.json, and
 * this module loads it.
 *
 * ## Why per-version files rather than one table
 *
 * A single VERSION_PATCHES array cannot say WHICH release each entry is for
 * without a comment nobody can check, and an `optional` patch that silently
 * misses looks identical to one that was never needed. Splitting them means a
 * version script lists exactly what that release needs, so applying it is
 * mandatory - a miss is an error, not a shrug - and the file is also the place
 * to write down how far that version has actually been taken.
 *
 * ## What a version script exports
 *
 *   version   must equal the filename, so a copied file cannot lie about itself
 *   pins      optional; cross-checked against ok-versions.json and NOT trusted
 *             over it. Present so that editing the pin list fails loudly here
 *             instead of quietly invalidating everything measured below.
 *   status    how far this release has been taken - see STATUS
 *   notes     what is known, and what the evidence was
 *   patches   staged edits this release needs. Applied like any other patch:
 *             a pattern that does not match is an ERROR.
 *   drop      extra core files to delete, if a release ships one that later
 *             ones do not. Usually absent.
 *   expect    optional { digest } from the last successful stage of this
 *             version. A mismatch is reported, not fatal - the toolchain and
 *             stage.js are both inputs and both move.
 *
 * Adding a release is copying the nearest neighbour, changing `version`,
 * setting `status: 'untried'`, and emptying `notes`.
 *
 * ## Where the pins come from: UPSTREAM RELEASE TAGS
 *
 * Both repositories tag their releases, and the tags name commits. The local
 * checkouts are forks with no tags of their own, which is why this was not
 * obvious - but the GitHub API has them, and every pin here has been checked
 * against one:
 *
 *     api.github.com/repos/trustcrypto/libraries/git/refs/tags
 *     api.github.com/repos/trustcrypto/OnlyKey-Firmware/git/refs/tags
 *
 * All nine OnlyKey-Firmware pins match their `vX.Y.Z-prod` tag exactly. On the
 * libraries side, v3.0.2, v3.0.1, v3.0.0, v2.1.2, v2.1.1, v2.1.0 and
 * v0.2-beta.8 match theirs (v2.1.1's is an annotated tag and dereferences to
 * the same commit). So these are not a convention and not an inference - they
 * are what upstream shipped.
 *
 * ## The two that have no tag, and how they were derived
 *
 * The libraries repository stops tagging at v3.0.2-prod. OnlyKey-Firmware has
 * v3.0.3-prod and v3.0.4-prod, both pointing at the SAME commit - the sketch
 * did not change between those releases - so only the libraries side needs
 * working out.
 *
 * `libraries/onlykey/onlykey.h` carries OKversionmaj/min/pat, so reading the
 * header at every commit gives which commits called themselves v3.0.3 and
 * which v3.0.4. That still leaves a range, and the RELEASE DATE closes it: the
 * pin is the last commit declaring that version at or before the day the
 * release was published.
 *
 * That rule is not invented for the occasion - it reproduces all seven tagged
 * libraries pins. It also corrects an earlier guess here. "The last commit of
 * the version's range" looked like the pattern and is wrong: commits keep the
 * old version number until the next bump, so a release is often followed by
 * more commits declaring it. v3.0.2 shipped on 2022-10-05 and two further
 * 3.0.2 commits landed on 2022-10-25, which is exactly why its tag is at
 * 5d7ce7a and not at the end of its range.
 *
 * Applied:
 *
 *   v3.0.3  published 2022-11-08  ->  a133bea (2022-11-04)
 *                                     9c99922 is 2022-11-26, after the release
 *   v3.0.4  published 2022-12-14  ->  c8804e3 (2022-11-30)
 *
 * ## What was tried before the tags were found, and why it failed
 *
 * Worth keeping so nobody repeats it. Rebuilding each candidate and comparing
 * bytes needs the pinned Arduino 1.6.5 + Teensyduino 1.27, whose compiler is a
 * Linux ELF, and the development machine has no Docker and no working WSL.
 * Comparing string tables out of the signed release images works - they are
 * readable once the block data is word-swapped - but no candidate inside a
 * range changes a literal that a production build keeps. Both dead ends; the
 * tags answered it in two requests.
