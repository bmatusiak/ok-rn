 * Worth staging EARLY rather than last: if the oldest release builds, the ones
 * between it and the working tree are very unlikely to be harder, and the whole
 * matrix is reachable. If it does not, the failure names the boundary.
 *
 * No Profile_Offset patch - measured uint8_t in both places at 8687474, same
 * as v2.1.1.
