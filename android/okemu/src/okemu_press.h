/*
 * okemu_press - button presses handed to the firmware, rather than sensed.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The other way to press a button here is okemu_set_button_ticks(), which
 * emulates a FINGER: the pad reads high for N rounds and touch_sense_loop()
 * counts them. That is a faithful emulation and it is what the press-band
 * tests exercise, but it is expensive, because a round only happens when the
 * firmware's scheduler runs checkKey() - `Task taskKey(TIME_POLL, checkKey)`
 * with `#define TIME_POLL 50`. A ten-tick tap plus the four idle rounds the
 * firmware needs to see the release is fourteen scheduler periods. Measured on
 * a Pixel 6a: 757-855ms for ONE press, so a seven-digit PIN took five to six
 * seconds of a person's time.
 *
 * The firmware itself shows the cheaper way, in the console parser it compiles
 * only under `#ifdef DEBUG`:
 *
 *     if (key_press == 0 && dbgQueueNext < dbgQueueLen) {
 *             button_selected = dbgQueueButton[dbgQueueNext];
 *             key_press       = dbgQueueDuration[dbgQueueNext];
 *             dbgQueueNext++;
 *     }
 *
 * It does not sense anything. `key_press` IS the duration touch_sense_loop()
 * returns and payload() bands on, so writing it directly produces exactly the
 * press the bands describe - and there is nothing to wait for.
 *
 * ## This is not that interface
 *
 * That block is behind `#ifdef DEBUG` and exists only in the development tree;
 * no released firmware in the version matrix contains it, and the `Serial`
 * channel it reads from is compiled out of a production build entirely. So it
 * is a MODEL, not something to switch on. Nothing here touches `Serial`,
 * SEREMU, or the DEBUG gate: this file is compiled unconditionally and works
 * against a firmware built exactly the way it ships.
 *
 * ## The one thing the firmware has to do
 *
 * `key_press` and `key_off` are function-local statics inside
 * touch_sense_loop(), which is why the firmware's own queue lives in there
 * too. So one line is injected at stage time, immediately before the existing
 * dispatch, and it is the only firmware change this needs:
 *
 *     okemu_press_take(&button_selected, &key_press);
 *     if ((key_press > 0) && (key_off > 2)) {
 *
 * Passing them in, rather than reaching for the firmware's symbols from here,
 * keeps this file free of firmware linkage entirely - and means the hand-over
 * happens ON THE FIRMWARE THREAD, which is what makes it safe to write a plain
 * int that the same thread is about to read.
